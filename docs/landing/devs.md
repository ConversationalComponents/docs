# Chatbot Developers

Explore CoCoHub's pre-built conversational components that make your chatbot more capable and accomplish the tasks you need.

Each component is meant to fulfill a specific purpose; for example, attaining a piece of information from a user, helping a user complete a certain task, entertaining a user, or informing them of new and relevant information.

We've made integrating components simple thanks to our set of SDKs. You can use the existing integration for most instances or integrate once and get access to the entire collection of components published on CoCoHub.

You can call components through a simple, unified REST API that is easy to embed in your chatbot. Moreover, you can view all of the components you are using in your workspace, which monitors the number of API requests, latency, and error rates, among other metrics.

CoCoHub components have been developed by our team as well as by a community of "CoCoHub Vendors": Trusted developers whose components achieved “qualified” status, following rigorous testing.
