## General
[Conversation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversation) is an interactive communication between two or more agents (virtual or real).

Each agent has their own agenda and goals.


The typical framing of a reinforcement learning scenario from each agent's point of view is such:

1. His environment is the other agent's which he observes and interprets to build his model of the world
2. He maintains state - his memory is based on previous observations and his model of the world 
3. He performs actions based on his state in this environment in order to achieve his goals

!!! note
    In a learned agent each action is paired with a reward. The agent agenda and goals are defined by these rewards.
