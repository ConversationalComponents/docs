# How to Customize a component

There are 2 ways to customize an exciting component. You can do it directly from the builder, or by choosing the component and customizing it from the hub.

Customize from the hub

1. Click on the hub icon on the side nav and choose the component you want to customize. Here you can read the purpose of each component, and test it before you choose to use it.
2. Choose the component you’d like to customize. Click on Use and the bottom section of the window. Now choose an ID - name your component. \
   **Super important: **You won’t be able to change the components name**, **so name it something you’ll recognize and understand.
3. Now, you’ll find yourself in the y components” section. Click on the 3 dots on the right side of your component. Choose “Edit component data”
4. Here, you’ll be able to re-phrase each one of the lines. The purpose of each line is written below the sample line.

-   Make sure you edit all the lines, or at least make sure the wording suits your bot. Each line should make sense in the context of bot and conversation, and fit your bot’s personality.

5. Click “Save” Once you’re done customizing ALL the lines (some components have more than one page, make sure you go over all the options)
6. Click on the builder in the side nav, click anywhere in the project you’d like to add your component to.
7. Find your customized component and add to the project. Just don’t forget to publish when done, you want the world to see your amazing bot, right?
