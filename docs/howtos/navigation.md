# How to use “navigation” based on user’s input

So, after nailing the part where the chatbot speaks - the “Say” - now we go to the **Navigation **- the part in the conversation when the user speaks.

Our role, as conversation designers, is to smoothly lead the user into saying what we planned (Happy Path). Generally, as in life in general, we need to be prepared for anything.

## 1. Left-click on the canvas and click on the navigation node

Click “Add an intent” and a menu will pop up. Now you can search for intents, or create ones for yourself

## 2. 1. Find an existing intent

- Type your desired intent in the search window, or
- Scroll down and up, up and down, until you find something fitting. 

Once you hover with the mouse over the intent, you’ll see what it does and some examples of relevant inputs. 
Now, by clicking on the eye button, you can get inside and see the complete variety of phrases and utterances.

So, intents are collections of semantically similar utterances that basically mean the same thing in a conversation. For example, “Yes” is a word, but “Yeah!”, “Sure”, “YESSS” and “Yup” also mean the same thing, and we should embrace them as well.

We've created dozens of intents that can help any individual, business and company and can expect most things the users will say.

In addition, we give "Anything Else" which leads to a general fallback - what your bot will answer if the user don't say anything you prepared for.

-   When you need the user’s opinion or answer for data-collection purposes - and the scope of answers is too wide (“What’s your favourite travel destination in the world?”)

-   When you don’t really need the user’s data at that point - but you want to make the user feel involved and engaged (“How was your day?”)

## 2. 2. Keywords

Keywords are the way to go when you expect the user to answer with a specific word, sentence or phrase; if the user won’t respond with these words, the conversation can be unfruitful.

For example, if you have a pet shop and you serve only people with dogs, cats and fish (which covers almost 99% of the pets owned in the USA), your chatbot can relate only to those people and filter out all the rest.

With keyword, you can design a different flow for every keyword or phrase

Or put all of them in the same keywords space, if you want to have the same flow from there onwards for all those keywords.

### CoCo Tip

If you’re choosing keywords, make sure you put all the relevant words and synonyms there, so you won’t miss anything that can fit - for example, if you write “cat” as an option, make sure you have “cats” and “feline” there too.
