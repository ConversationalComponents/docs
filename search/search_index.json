Conversational Components make chatbot building easier by deconstructing conversations into components.

It\u2019s time to make the development of conversational A.I. a collaborative process. When you build on reusable and customizable parts, you create better chatbots to make conversation easy. You\u2019ll be able to stack a conversation with pre-built dialogue blocks. Each of these blocks maintains user context throughout the conversation. They\u2019re also reusable and customizable, saving you precious time by eliminating the need to create a dialogue management system from scratch for every new bot you build. And the best part? CoCos are simple to implement into any bot framework! For Chatbot Developers It's really easy to use Conversational Components in your chatbots. With CoCo, you can call components through a simple unified, REST format that is easy to embed in your chatbot. Moreover, you can view all of the components you are using in your user profile, which monitors the number of API requests, latency, and error rates, among other metrics. For more on using components, check out the Basics - Your First Component Call section or our CoCos for Developers page. For Component Vendors If you\u2019ve already built excellent components of your own, we make it simple for you to distribute and monetize it. Adding your component to CoCo's Marketplace offers you several benefits. You\u2019ll get instant exposure to our growing user base, a search-engine-optimized profile page for your component, as well as features like user management and billing services.

In the following tutorial we'll implement a CoCo component into our Dialogflow conversation flow. A component will be triggered when a relevant intent matches. More specifically, we'll use the CoCo register component from the CoCo Marketplace . CoCo SDK Installation To Dialogflow: Import CoCo Dialogflow SDK functions. Access your agent fulfillment tab: Enable the inline editor functionality: Add CoCo SDK To Package JSON: Copy the line: \"@conversationalcomponents/dialogflow-sdk\" : \"^1.0.2\" Import CoCo SDK functions: Copy the line: const { cocoComponent , cocoContext } = require ( \"@conversationalcomponents/dialogflow-sdk\" ); Create Intent For CoCo Context. The intent is needed to maintain CoCo context through the conversation as long as CoCo handles the multi-turn session with the end user. Access intent tab: Create CoCo context intent: The intent must have an input context called coco , also it has to be configured with the catch all functionality (It is illustrated in the Training Phrases section of the picture below).

It will ask you for billing info. Also Google provides a substantial free quota for this service, so you won't actually be charged. Plug Component To Your Conversation Flow. Access CoCo Marketplace and choose the relevant component: Add the component to your CoCo workspace: Plug the component in to your conversation flow by mapping the relevant intent: Copy the line: intentMap . set ( 'account.open' , cocoComponent ( \"register_vp3\" )); Check Your Bot: In the image blow, you can see that we received an answer from the component when the correct intent triggered: Also you'll notice a multi-turn conversation supplied by the component:","title":"Plug a CoCo Component inside Dialogflow Conversation Flow."},{"location":"tutorials/plug_coco_component_inside_dialogflow_conversation/#plug-a-coco-component-inside-dialogflow-conversation-flow","text":"In the following tutorial we'll implement a CoCo component into our Dialogflow conversation flow.

Go to the prebuilt agents menu: Choose banking agent: Import banking agent: Authentication With Dialogflow(Service Account Key): Extract agent service account key: Go to agent settings. Go to service accounts: Generate JSON key: Place it in code sample directory as service_accout.json: Code Sample Overview: We'll use a Flask application to expose our bot throut an API.
