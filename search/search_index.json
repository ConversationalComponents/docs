Conversational Components make chatbot building easier by deconstructing conversations into components. All components hold context over multiple turns of conversation to better engage your users, with logic wired into the conversational flow. All you have to do is incorporate them into your bots. It\u2019s time to make the development of conversational A.I. a collaborative process. When you build on reusable and customizable parts, you create better chatbots to make conversation easy. You\u2019ll be able to stack a conversation with pre-built dialogue blocks. Each of these blocks maintains user context throughout the conversation. They\u2019re also reusable and customizable, saving you precious time by eliminating the need to create a dialogue management system from scratch for every new bot you build. And the best part? CoCos are simple to implement into any bot framework! For Chatbot Developers It's really easy to use Conversational Components in your chatbots. With CoCo, you can call components through a simple unified, REST format that is easy to embed in your chatbot. Moreover, you can view all of the components you are using in your user profile, which monitors the number of API requests, latency, and error rates, among other metrics. For more on using components, check out the Basics - Your First Component Call section or our CoCos for Developers page. For Component Vendors If you\u2019ve already built excellent components of your own, we make it simple for you to distribute and monetize it. Adding your component to CoCo's Marketplace offers you several benefits.

I'll guide you thorough the whole process, including the implementation of the CoCo 'Register' component. Setup Prebuilt Bot On Dialogflow: Create a Dialogflow account. Go to the prebuilt agents menu: Choose banking agent: Import banking agent: Authentication With Dialogflow(Service Account Key): Extract agent service account key: Go to agent settings. Go to service accounts: Generate JSON key: Place it in code sample directory as service_accout.json: Code Sample Overview: We'll use a Flask application to expose our bot throut an API. For communication with Dialogflow we'll use Dialogflow SDK and for communication with the CoCo component we'll use CoCo SDK. Code to code sample repository: https://github.com/ConversationalComponents/webinar/tree/master/py Flow: Global Variable current_comp: MAIN_COMP = \"default\" # Current component on which the session is running. current_comp = MAIN_COMP The current_comp global variable will be \"default\" when the conversation is controlled by Dialogflow. When the control is passed to a CoCo component the value of the current_comp variable will be the CoCo component ID which is in control of the conversation right now. CoCo And Dialogflow Access Functions: Dialogflow and CoCo request wrapped with process functions. Let's take a look at the process_dialogflow function: def process_dialogflow ( session_id , text , language_code = \"en\" ): \"\"\" Returns bot output for user input. Using the same `session_id` between requests allows continuation of the conversation. Arguments: session_id (string): Current session ID. text (string): User input. language_code (string): Context language.

QueryInput ( text = text_input ) response = session_client . detect_intent ( session = session , query_input = query_input ) return response . query_result . intent . display_name , response . query_result . fulfillment_text The function receives the session_id and user input then returns intent display name and response text. And there is the process_coco function: def process_coco ( component_id , session_id , input_text ): \"\"\" Process user input at a coco component. Arguments: component_id (string): Target component ID. session_id (string): Target session ID. input_text (string): User input text. Returns: CoCo component output.

It's quick, easy, and lets you leverage powerful AI to engage your users. Installing CoCoHub plugin in Wordpress We'll start by opening our Wordpress dashboard, and selecting PLUGINS from the drawer. Click the ADD NEW button (marked in red oval). Search for CoCoHub in keywords, and click the INSTALL NOW button on the card (marked in red oval). Now we need to activate the plugin. Click the ACTIVATE button on the card. Great! The plugin is installed and activated. We still need to add the shortcode to the pages on which we would like our chat window to show. Let's go to a page in our Wordpress site and edit any field. Now add the [cocobot] shortcode and update the page. All done! If you navigate to the page you've just updated, you should see a chat window there. It's the interface to a Cocobot, the Conversational Components evangelist bot. You'll probably want to build your own bot, though, so let's get to that. Building a bot in CoCoHub Start by heading over to CoCoHub , and signing in or registering, if you're a first time user. Welcome! When you're ready, choose Bots Studio from the drawer, and click ADD to create a new bot. Now we should have something that looks like this: Glue works with Nodes and Links - nodes are containers for components, and links route conversation flow between components. Let's take a deeper look at the leftmost node: The gold star in the rightmost corner indicates that it's an Entry component. This is the first component the bot's user will converse with. There must always be an entry component in each Glue. The text field containing namer_vp3 is the components associated with this node. The default component is namer_vp3, but you can use any component from Cocohub here. Click on it to enter search mode. DRAG TO LINK button creates a link between nodes. We'll discuss this in greater detail below. This is what a couple of linked nodes look like. Incoming link from another node means that another node has an action on which conversation flow will route to this component. Outgoing link is a route from a node to a different one. This is what's created using the DRAG TO LINK button. Outgoing link controls allow you to change the outgoing link. The text field containing \"component done\" allows you to select the action on which routing to a different node will happen. The default action is \"component done\" - that is, when the component has achieved it's goal. You can also delete the link here. Non-entry node options is a menu of controls for a non-entry node - it allows you to set a node as entry or to delete it. Parameters is a collapsible field for components that have parameters associated with them. \"email_pv1\" component has them, and when expanded the parameters look like this: If an email is associated with your account, it'll be in the address field. This is the email address to which the results will be sent once the bot is finished. Warning If there is no email in the address field, you won't get the email! Last, but not least, the general Glue controls: Save and Undo buttons are only enabled if you can save or undo. Saving generates a new Glue ID, and resets the chat window. COPY GLUE ID button - copies the last saved Glue ID to your clipboard. Chat window is where you can talk to the latest saved version of your bot. Please note that if SAVE button is turned on, you have unsaved changes which will not be reflected in the chat. This bot will get the user's name, and when it's finished getting the name it'll also get the user's email address. Once all that is done, it'll send you an email with the user's details. Now we can save the changes ( SAVE button in the control panel ), and chat to our newly created bot in the chat window. Pro Tip Everything in Coco bots is made of components. The component for making a bot is called a Glue component - it glues other components together. Since a glue is also a component, you can use glue components as nodes in a glue! Nicely done! Time to use our new bot in the Cocohub Wordpress plugin. Let's save any changes we have, and click the COPY GLUE ID button. Now let's head back to Wordpress admin dashboard, and configure our plugin to use the Glued bot. Configuring CoCoHub Wordpress plugin Head over to Plugins, and click SETTINGS on CoCoHub plugin. Now we just to have to pass the ID of the Glue component we created into component-id or url field (marked in red oval), and click SAVE CHANGES. All done! Head back to the page to which you inserted [cocobot] shortcode, and chat with your Glued bot from the comfort of your Wordpress site. Or change the other settings first: Name is the name that'll appear in the header of your bot's chat window Bot Greeting is what the bot will say to user when the chat window fist loads Height and Width define the dimensions of your bot's chat window Is Fabless is a checkbox for whether the chat window has a close/open button or not. When it's on, the chat window cannot be closed. Chat-window is open by default is a checkbox for whether the chat window starts opened. Only relevant if Is Fabless is off. That concludes the tutotial. Hopefully it'll put you on the path to making awesome, useful, engaging and fantastic bots!","title":"Build a modular bot on wordpress"},{"location":"tutorials/wp_cocobot/#wordpress-cocohub-tutorial","text":"In this tutorial we'll guide you through adding a chat window to a conversational bot on a Wordpress page as well as using CoCoHub visual editing tools to create your own bot from components.
